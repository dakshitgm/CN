# OSI Model

![picture alt](images/computer-network-osi-model-layers.png "Title is optional")<br><br>

* OSI is layered model for consist of 7 layers
* It describes how data is send from one computer to other
* each layer has diffrant function
* while sending each layer get data from upper layer and give data to lower layer
* while sending each layer get data from lower layer and give data to upper layer
* OSI is only refrance model and not practically used.
* 7 Layers of OSI Model
  * Application
  * Session
  * Presentation
  * Transport
  * Network
  * Data Link
  * Physical

# Physical Layer

* Lowest Layer in hierachy
* deal with physical transmition of data bits .
* while sending it converts 0 & 1 into electrical signal
* while reciving converts electrical signal into 0, 1.

## Functions

### Bit Syncronization: 
provide clock timing. Determining the boundary (start and end) of signal bit i.e. time window for a bit.
<br><br>
  
### Bit Rate control
if sender is fast and reciver is slow physical layer manges the data tranmition rate i.e. bit transmission per second. 
<br><br>

### Topology
physical layer defines way of diffrant devices arranged in netwok
<br><br>

### Transmition modes 
it defines mode of data flow between two connected device

    Simplex: one way communication. only one sender can send and other only recive ie. Brodcasting, eg FM radio

    Half duplex: both user can send but at a time one sends and other recives two user cannot send data at a time. e.g Walkie-talkie 

    Full duplex: both can send and recive at a time. e.g phone call

___Devices works on physical layer:  Hub, Repeater, Modem, Cables___

# Data Link Layer

* Responsible for node to node delivery of data.
* It is responsible for error-free data transmission 
* Transmit data using mac address
* receive packet from Network layer 
* packet further divided into frames depending on the frame size of NIC(Network Interface Card)
* The Receiverâ€™s MAC address is obtained by placing an ARP(Address Resolution Protocol) request and destination host will reply with its MAC address
  
* Two sublayers
    * Logical Link control
    * Media acsess control

## Functions of Data Link Layer

### Framing
Its convert data packet into data frame and add meaningfull header to ensure transmission of data to meaningfull reciever

### Physical Addressing 
Adds physical address of sender and reciever to the headder of each frame

### Error Control
Error Correction Detection algo used to control Error. and retransmit damaged packet

[Error Control Protocols](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/error-control-in-data-link-layer/)

### Flow Control
Data transmission rate must be constant on both side else data get corrupted
flow control manage the amount of data can send before reciving acknoledgement

[Flow Control Protocols](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/flow-control-in-data-link-layer/)


### Access control: 
When a single communication channel is shared by multiple devices, MAC sub-layer of data link layer helps to determine which device has control over the channel at a given time

___Devices works on physical layer:  Switch & Bridge___
